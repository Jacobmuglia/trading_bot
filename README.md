## GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)

GARCH is a statistical model used to analyze and forecast time series data with changing volatility. It is particularly useful in financial markets where volatility clustering is observed, meaning periods of high volatility tend to cluster together.

### GARCH Model Equation

The GARCH(p, q) model is expressed as follows:

$$
\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \alpha_i \varepsilon_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2
$$

Where:
- \( \sigma_t^2 \) = Conditional variance at time \( t \)
- \( \omega \) = Constant term
- \( \alpha_i \) = Coefficient of the lagged squared errors
- \( \varepsilon_{t-i} \) = Error term at time \( t-i \)
- \( \beta_j \) = Coefficient of the lagged conditional variance
- \( \sigma_{t-j}^2 \) = Conditional variance at time \( t-j \)
- \( p \) = Number of lagged squared errors in the model
- \( q \) = Number of lagged conditional variances in the model

### Interpreting GARCH

- **Volatility Persistence**: GARCH models capture the tendency of volatility to persist over time. High volatility periods are likely to be followed by more high volatility, and vice versa.

- **Impact of Shocks**: GARCH models distinguish between the short-term impact of shocks (captured by \( \varepsilon_{t-i}^2 \)) and the long-term impact (captured by \( \sigma_{t-j}^2 \)) on volatility.

- **Forecasting Volatility**: GARCH models can be used to forecast future volatility based on past data. This is particularly useful for risk management and derivative pricing in financial markets.

### Using GARCH in Trading and Risk Management

1. **Volatility Forecasting**: Traders and investors can use GARCH models to forecast future volatility and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

2. **Risk Management**: GARCH models help in estimating the risk of financial assets and portfolios, allowing for better risk management practices.

3. **Option Pricing**: GARCH models are widely used in option pricing models, as they provide more accurate estimates of future volatility compared to simpler models.

### Limitations of GARCH

- **Model Complexity**: GARCH models can be complex and computationally intensive, especially when estimating parameters for large datasets.

- **Assumption of Stationarity**: GARCH models assume that the time series data is stationary, which may not always hold true in practice.

### Conclusion

GARCH models are powerful tools for analyzing and forecasting time series data with changing volatility patterns. While they have their limitations, they are widely used in finance and economics for risk management, trading strategies, and option pricing.


## RSI (Relative Strength Index) Investing

RSI is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

### How RSI is Calculated

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

$$
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)
$$

Where:
- RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss over a specified period.

### Interpreting RSI

- **Overbought Conditions (RSI > 70)**: When RSI crosses above the 70 level, it suggests that the asset may be overbought, meaning the price may have risen too far, too fast. Traders might consider selling or taking profits.
  
- **Oversold Conditions (RSI < 30)**: Conversely, when RSI drops below 30, it indicates that the asset may be oversold, suggesting that the price may have fallen too far, too fast. Traders might consider buying or entering long positions.

## Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a popular technical analysis tool introduced by John Bollinger. They consist of three lines plotted on a price chart: a simple moving average (SMA) in the middle, and an upper band and a lower band that are typically two standard deviations away from the SMA.

### Calculation of Bollinger Bands

1. **Middle Band (SMA)**: The middle band is typically a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) of the price.
  
2. **Upper Band**: The upper band is calculated by adding two standard deviations to the SMA.
  
3. **Lower Band**: The lower band is calculated by subtracting two standard deviations from the SMA.

### Interpreting Bollinger Bands

- **Volatility Measurement**: Bollinger Bands expand and contract based on the volatility of the price. Narrow bands indicate low volatility, while wide bands indicate high volatility.

- **Overbought and Oversold Conditions**: Prices that touch or exceed the upper band may be considered overbought, suggesting a potential reversal or correction. Conversely, prices that touch or fall below the lower band may be considered oversold, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.

- **Squeeze Patterns**: When the bands contract towards each other, it indicates decreasing volatility, often preceding a significant price movement. Traders may anticipate a breakout when a squeeze pattern occurs.
